# as You can see hash character '#' at the start of the line tells parser that this line is just a comment
# There are three typs of hierarchy in this file, marked by indentations. The more 'indented' link/adress is, the lower is in hierarchy

# Websites hierarchy
# Category[no indentation] - it is showed on website as separate 'table', in which You will insert website list
#     Website[4 spaces or 1 tabualtor] - adress to cetain website, generally it should point to 'main' site if You want it's sub-sites to work
#        Subsite[8 spaces or 2 tabualtors] - it's subsite for it's parent (main)website. Full adress can be provided, but it's possible to skip adress to 'main site' it sub-site adress starts with '/' character
